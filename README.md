# SQL EDA and Analytics Project  

This project is a collection of SQL scripts I built to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and generate **business insights** from a relational database.  

The goal was to create a structured workflow that covers everything from **database exploration** to **segmentation**, **performance tracking**, **cumulative trends**, and **reporting**.  
Each script focuses on a specific analytical task and follows SQL best practices for clarity and reusability.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure  

The repository is organized into scripts, each serving a clear purpose:  

- **01_Database_Exploration.sql** â†’ Explore database objects, schemas, and tables  
- **02_Dimensions_Exploration.sql** â†’ Dive into customers, products, and other key dimensions  
- **03_Date_Range_Exploration.sql** â†’ Filter and analyze data over different date ranges  
- **04_Measures_Exploration.sql** â†’ Work with business measures and KPIs  
- **05_Magnitude_Analysis.sql** â†’ Analyze absolute and relative values  
- **06_Ranking_Analysis.sql** â†’ Rank entities (top products, top customers, etc.)  
- **07_Change_Over_Time_Analysis.sql** â†’ Identify changes and trends over time  
- **08_Cumulative_Analysis.sql** â†’ Track cumulative growth and progress  
- **09_Performance_Analysis.sql** â†’ Evaluate KPIs and performance benchmarks  
- **10_Data_Segmentation.sql** â†’ Segment data by customer, product, or region  
- **11_Part_To_Whole_Analysis.sql** â†’ Contribution analysis (e.g., market share)  
- **12_Report_Customers.sql** â†’ Generate customer-focused reporting views  
- **13_Report_Products.sql** â†’ Generate product-focused reporting views
